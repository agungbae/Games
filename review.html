							<h4>History of Calpheon</h4>
							<p>There was no exception. Even the nobles and the priests were forced to abandon their children.
								Those that lived outside the castle walls met a horrendous death. Their lifeless bodies were burned to prevent 
								the spread of the disease.The pandemic that shook humanity to its core simply disappeared without a trace one day, 
								but not before indiscriminately afflicting both nobles and commoners alike. This led the commoners to think they 
								may actually be no different than the nobles. They prayed day and night in hopes of stopping this dreadful calamity, 
								but Elion did not answer their prayers.
								The nobles that survived the calamity urgently called for other nobles to preserve their hierarchy in Calpheon. 
								Elionian priests began spreading the lie that the Valencians were the heathens brought this disaster upon everyone, 
								and that they used the black crystal within alchemy for these nefarious purposes. The kings added that the Black Desert 
								must be conquered in order to stop any further catastrophe.
								They made this promise to the lower class, who were starting to realize the value of the labor that they had been doing for 
								free up until that point. An alliance was soon established, and this is how the long, bloody war between Calpheon and Valencia 
								first started. </p>

							<h4>History of Serendia</h4>
							<p>Crucio Domongatt found no reason for war. He did not view himself as a servant of Elion unlike his father. Though commoners 
								seemed to have recovered from the restlessness of war, Crucio was not pleased with the way King Dahad treated them. 
								Crucio was crowned King of Heidel when he was 27 years old, and announced to Calpheon that they would not be assisting in the expedition. 
								The priests of Calpheon were frustrated with the situation, 
								and they feared that they would lose their influence if the expedition came to a halt. There were Elion Chapels wherever the expedition went. 
								The priests originally planned to spread Elionism all throughout Balenos. The priests criticized Crucio’s decision, but Dahad remained silent. 
								King Crucio carefully reviewed his options. He knew waging a war against Calpheon would be unwise, as there were many followers of Elion in the 
								Heidel military who remained loyal to his father. After countless meetings Crucio failed to make any headway. he was unable to overcome 
								the pressure and reluctantly agreed to the wishes of Calpheon. Dahad welcomed King Crucio’s decision, and suggested Crucio should prepare 
								an expedition to see Valencia Castle. This took 2 years to prepare.
								Domongatt already knew the road to the Black Desert like the back of his hand. However, a powerful wind blew all across Mediah making 
								it difficult to travel. Sand storms also made it difficult for the expedition to advance. The expedition hid and waited for the wind to die down, 
								though it was a week before Mediah even became visible.

							<h4>History of Mediah</h4>
							<p>Fire devoured Mediah Castle, and darkness settled on Mediah for three days. The thick blackness that blanketed the land made it impossible to see 
								the sun or the moon. Those experiencing the phenomena quaked in fear and relied on torches to navigate through the darkness. Altinova was no 
								exception. Some of the citizens in Altinova grew violent and aggressive, with some even screaming as they ran out of the city. The only 
								thing visible in the thick darkness that surrounded the land was Mediah Castle, burning in the distance. But it did not come as a surprise 
								to anyone to see such an incompetent monarch collapse. There were those that mourned the loss of Bareeds II, but none were pleased to find 
								that the yungest heir had survived. Illezera disappeared without a trace and rumors about Illezera began to spread throughout the land. </p>

							<h4>History of Valencia</h4>
							<p>Valencia, The Royal Nesser 
								<br>Someone led the young man to the ancient chambers. When the door opened, men and women were on their knees as if they had been 
								waiting for him. As the young man made his way up the stairs that led to the chambers, he saw a room filled with treasures. Out of all 
								the treasures that laid before him, the young man reached for the golden crown, becoming the moment the first king of Valencia was 
								crowned. The 14th monarch of Valencia, led by Imur Nesser and one of great misfortune and disaster, had ended 50 years prior. 
								The citizens of Valencia wish not to remember those horrific days, when they had to deal with both the black death and the Aakman 
								Massacare, considered the most atrocious event in Valencian history… </p>

							<h4>History of Kamasylvia</h4>
							<p>8 years after the Ahib escaped to the Arid Land, an Ahib fortress was built in Rodilita, shrouded in darkness. There were also rumors 
								that they worked with the Salun Bears to create a new weapon. The dried thorns sprouted up, ready for blood, and the barren earth swayed 
								from the bright flames of the Ahib. Lemoria Guards stationed at the eastern side of Kamasylvian Steppes observed the Ahib movements and 
								raised their guard. One day, the Lemoria Guards standing watch at Duzak Tunnel fought against the Ahib coming from the Arid Lands. Despite 
								Lemoria sending reinforcements, but the results were horrifying, losing half the forces sent to protect the plains. The Ahib retreated 
								once the Kamasylvia priests sealed Duzak Tunnel off. These Ahib were different from the ones they were familiar with. What could they 
								have done to become this powerful? They feared them as they did when they faced the dark spirits. As Ahib’s evil influence spread, Acher 
								grew nervous. Kamasylve was almost fully restored, but the peace that had been kept for so long was being threatened by the Ahib. </p>

							<h4>History of Drieghan</h4>
							<p>There was once a race that, not by anyone's choice, became covered in the Dragon's blood. Their skin hardened like that of a dragon, 
								and their bodies started to grow in new ways. They eventually started to call themselves "Sherekhan." Their first settlement was to 
								the east of Drieghan, and this new eventually saw Akum rise to become its first ruler. However, this new society crumbled before the 
								end of their first year. A terrible drought came over the land they settled on, and they started to die out on this desolate land from 
								sheer thirst.
								<br>As Serekhan warriors faced their death, one clerk stated that this disaster was the price they were paying for bathing in the 
								Dragon's blood. He expected little more than a single passage in the annals of history for the rise and fall of the Sherekhan. But as 
								Akum, the longest surviving Sherekhan that killed the dragon, was about to take his last breath, he took out the tooth of the dragon to 
								the future generation and said, "Bury this in the ground and settle on the land where the blessed rain falls." This is when the future 
								generations of the people that died to the dragon's curse started their nomadic life following their ancestor's will</p>
